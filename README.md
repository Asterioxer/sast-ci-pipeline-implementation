# Infrastructure-Wide SAST Implementation and Standardization

- This repository provides a standardized, reusable framework enabling Static Application Security Testing (SAST) across backend services.

- The goal is to embed security scanning into CI/CD pipelines in a scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly way. This will help catch security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the time and cost of fixing them later. It will also help ensure that all backend services undergo security testing before deployment, improving the overall security of the infrastructure.

## This repository contains:

1. Reusable CI/CD templates for SAST
2. Organization-wide security policies
3. Onboarding and operational documentation
